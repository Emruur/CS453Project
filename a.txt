Now i want to create a frontend application for this application.
I want to use plain js html and bootstrap5 for styling.

I will have 2 pages

Page1: index.html
this page will display the all avaliable analysis with and alk the dates analyzed for a repo_name
This page should display each repo as a card and available dates should be displayed in the card
If a analysis is in progress it should display a spinner

There should be a card with a + icon for creating a new analysis
When + is pressed it should open up a form modal to recieve the repo url.
    Errors should be handles when there is an existing analysys in progress


Page2: Analysis for a particular repo 
    this is going to be implemented later. for now you can just dump the json
