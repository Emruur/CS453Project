Writ me a flask app with the following routes

get_all_analysis: GET
    - returns the names of the repositories with an get_all_analysis, if a repo has multiple analysis with different 
    dates return all the dates if a repo is in progess return the repo name with the in_progress status. A repo is in status if its repo_name is in in_progress directory
    example response(not the actual reponse types should be proper json types):
    analysys{
        rep1: 11.11.1111
        rep2: 22.22.2222, 22.23.2222
        rep3: 12.11.1111
        rep4: 12.11.2222, 13.11.1111, 14.11.1111
        rep5: in_progress
    }

get_analysis(repo_name, date): GET
    returns the contents of the json file with repo name and date. It should return different error messages in the case no repo or no date with repo. Or the case where the analysisi is still not finished

create_analysis(repo_url): POST
    it will return an error message if there is a repo analysis in progress. If not it will start an analysis(to be implemented)
