I want to create a react frontend app styled with bootstrap for this project
It will have two pages
    1: index
        this page will show all exsiting analysis and in progreess analysis 
        and also should have the functionality to create an analysis
            - im thinking of displaying these as cards in a grid, the card with + will open a modal to let user enter the repo_url
            - the rest of the cards show the existing analyses, once clicked it will direct let user select a date of analysis then will direct to anaysis page
            - if there is an analysis that is in progress it will be display as a disabled card
    2: analysis
        for now it can just dump the json
